<h2>FinTeen â€“ Gamified Financial Literacy for Iranian Teens</h2>
  <p><strong>FinTeen</strong> is an innovative mobile game designed to teach financial literacy to Iranian teenagers under 12 through engaging hyper-casual gameplay. Instead of using traditional methods like textbooks and lectures, the game educates players through interactive challenges and financial decision-making during play.</p>
  
    <p>Players face simple yet thought-provoking financial choices such as saving versus spending, learning the basics of budgeting, saving, and investing. These decisions are embedded within fun game mechanics, making the learning experience both intuitive and memorable.</p>
  
    <p>The game has demonstrated strong engagement metrics, with over <strong>60% daily user activity</strong> and a <strong>projected 75% revenue growth</strong>. These figures reflect both its educational value and its commercial viability.</p>
  
    <p>As the concept creator and motion designer, I led the visual storytelling, UX planning, and collaborated on gameplay mechanics to ensure both learning and fun were seamlessly integrated.</p>
  
    <p>FinTeen aims to empower the next generation with practical money skills from an early age, while offering long-term scalability and potential for partnerships with banks, educational institutions, and sponsors.</p>
  
    <p><em>Play smart. Grow wise.</em></p>
